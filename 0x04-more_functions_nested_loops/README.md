# **0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops**
## 
### Description
 This project is about understanding nested loops, C-functions and prototypes
### Mandatory Tasks
| Folder | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [0-isupper.c](0-isupper.c) | Write a function that checks for uppercase character. |
| [1-isdigit.c](1-isdigit.c) | Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9). |
| [2-mul.c](2-mul.c) | Write a function that multiplies two integers. |
| [3-print_numbers.c](3-print_numbers.c) | Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. |
| [4-print_most_numbers.c](4-print_most_numbers.c) | Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. |
| [5-more_numbers.c](5-more_numbers.c) | Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line. |
| [6-print_line.c](6-print_line.c) | Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal. |
| [7-print_diagonal.c](7-print_diagonal.c) | Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal. |
| [8-print_square.c](8-print_square.c) | Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line. |
| [9-fizz_buzz.c](9-fizz_buzz.c) | Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. |
| [10-print_triangle.c](10-print_triangle.c) | Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line. |
